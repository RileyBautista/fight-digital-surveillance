If a Doctor did only the bare minimum, would you trust them? The same applies to your privacy. Companies and schools are only doing the bare minimum at protecting your privacy</p>

                    <p >Within my own school and many other schools within the Student Data Privacy Consortium, companies are simply using a template DPA oftentimes not personalized to the company, the data they collect, and additional important information. <br><br> This is the bare minimum, the law requires it but you should advocate for your school to create their own DPA with their companies that is stronger then the bare minimum, as of now most schools are "subscribing" to DPAs created in-collaboration with unrelated organizations and schools. The bare minimum is a foundation for companies to build on if they're able to however an insane amount of large companies have failed to protect student privacy and are only meeting the bare minimum</p>

                    <p class=>One voice is unlikely to make a difference, but you can be the spark to the fire for student privacy and against student digital surveillance. Work with your peers! Get them on-board and ask for their support in creating open letters, statements, and whatnot to get the support of your peers in the fight against Digital Surveillance, Censorship, and the continual destruction of Student Privacy.</p>
